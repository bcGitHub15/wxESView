# wxESView
wxWidgets 3.1.2 version of electrostatic field viewer

Initial code is for wx 3.0 version. Goal is to move to modern OpenGL using GPU resident arrays, our own GPU code, and our own matrix stack.

Initial directory structure is experimental. I am trying to make cleaner divisions between the various code groups. I have separate repositories for various parts of the lower-kevel framework, including the scanner and the geometry code.
